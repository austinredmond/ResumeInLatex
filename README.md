# ResumeInLatex
 A resume I wrote using Latex.

# Acknowledgement
 This resume was written using Vic Demuzere's guide on Creating a C.V. with
 LaTeX and moderncv. The original guide can be found at the URL
 https://vic.demuzere.be/articles/curriculum-vitae-cv-with-latex-moderncv/
 
# Purpose
 The tex file can be used to generate a PDF resume with consistent formatting. 
 The contents of the resume can be edited and a new PDF resume can be quickly
 generated.
